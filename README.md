# Tenzies game
Tenzies is a simple and fun dice game. The primary objective is to roll ten dice and get all of them to show the same number as quickly as possible.


This is a web application game developed using React and Vite. In this project, I utilized my React skills to create a game where the objective is to roll ten dice and get all of them to show the same number in the shortest time possible.

The game features:

* Random generation of ten numbers.
* The use of useState and useEffect hooks for dynamic functionality.
* Styling implemented with vanilla CSS.
* A chronometer to track the time taken to win the game.
* A best time display, stored using the localStorage feature to keep track of the fastest game completion.
